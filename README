#TestIterator
1) TODO also try with a LinkedList - does it make any difference behaviorally? (ignore performance)
- It does not make any difference behaviorally.
2) TODO what happens if you use list.remove(Integer.valueOf(77))?
- ConcurrentModificationException

#TestList
1) TODO also try with a LinkedList - does it make any difference behaviorally? (ignore performance)
- It does not make any difference behaviorally.
2) TODO answer: what does this method do?
- Removes index 5 from the list.
3) TODO answer: what does this one do?
- Removes number with value of 5 from the list.

#TestPerformance
1) TODO run test and record running times for SIZE = 10, 100, 1000, 10000, ...
- 10: 12ms
- 100: 18ms
- 1000: 19ms
- 10000: 147ms
- 100000: 10s 184ms
2) TODO answer: which of the two lists performs better as the size increases?
- The array-list performs better. When size and reps = 100,000, linked-list
  takes more than double the time that array-list takes.
